# Reporting a Security Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability, **DO NOT** disclose it in the public immediately! Instead, give us the possibility to fix it beforehand.
So please donâ€™t report your finding using GitHub issues and better head over to [https://eclipse.org/security](https://eclipse.org/security) and learn how to disclose a vulnerability in a safe and responsible manner
