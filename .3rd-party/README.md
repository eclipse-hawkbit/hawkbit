# Third-Party Dependencies

This folder provides listings of all 3rd-party dependencies incl. their licenses. There is a dedicated subfolder for
each release (and milestone) holding the release-specific information.

The files are generated using
the [check-dependencies.sh](https://github.com/eclipse-hawkbit/hawkbit/tree/master/check-dependencies.sh) script. The
script makes use of the [Eclipse Dash License Tool](https://github.com/eclipse/dash-licenses) which identifies and vets
the licenses of the project content.
