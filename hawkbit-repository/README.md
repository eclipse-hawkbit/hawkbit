sets, software modules etc.

#Concepts

## Rollout

A rollout consists of the distribution set and a target-query-filter which defines the targets to be updated in this
rollout. The targets within this filter are split up in configured amount of _Deployment Groups_ at creation time.

When starting a rollout, for all targets within this rollout deployment actions will be created. The deployment actions
of the first group will be started immediately all other deployment actions will be scheduled.

> Due rollouts might include a large number of targets and deployment group, creation as well as starting a rollout
> might take some time and therefore the creation and starting of an rollout is executed asynchronously. The creation and
> starting progress is reflected by the rollout's status attribute

### Rollout Creation

The targets reflected by the target-query-filter is interpreted at creation time. Only targets which have been created
at that time are included in the rollout. Targets which are created after the rollout creation will not be included. At
rollout creation time all necessary deployment groups containing the targets will be created. Dynamically adding targets
to a created or running rollout is currently not supported.

### Rollout Starting

The rollout is using the same concept based on _deployment acionts_ per target. All necessary _deployment acionts_ will
be created at starting point but not all _deployment acionts_ will be set to running. Only the _deployment acionts_ of
the first _deployment group_ is set to running, all other actions are created in _scheduled_ state.   
If targets having not finished _deployment actions_ at rollout starting time, these action are tried to cancel (state:
canceling). Scheduled actions from another rollout are canceled directly on server side because they were never running
before and can be safely canceled.

> Multiple rollouts can be running at the same time, but if the rollouts effect the same targets they will interfer the
> targets _deployment actions_ e.g. canceling/cancel already running/scheduled _deployment actions_.

### Deployment Group Condition/Action

#### Success Condition/Action

A _success condition_ defines when a deployment group is interpreted as success and triggers the _success action_. E.g.
a threshold of successfully updated targets within the group.

The _success action_ is executed if the _success_condition_ is fullfilled. Currently only the _success action_ starting
the next following deployment group is available.

#### Error Condition/Action

A _error condition_ defines when a deployment group is interpreted as failure and triggers the _error action_. E.g. a
threshold of update failures of targets within the group.

The _error action_ is executed if the _error condition_ is fullfilled. Currently only the _error action_ pausing the
whole rollout is available, a paused rollout can be resumed by a user.

### Rollout Scheduler

The rollout is managed by a scheduler task which is checking for rollouts in _running_ state. This is done atomic by
updating the row in the database, so only the rollouts are checked and processed for the current instance to avoid that
multiple instances are processing a rollout.

> Due the scheduler, it might take some time until a rollouts is processed and switching is state or starting the next
> deployment group.
