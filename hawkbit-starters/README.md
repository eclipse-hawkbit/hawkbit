This is a set
of [Spring Boot Starters](http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#using-boot-starter) that
allows to quick start a spring boot based application with hawkBit's core functionality.

The [all in one](hawkbit-boot-starter) starter contains the complete feature set in addition we provide four starters
for the hawkBit interfaces. They can be combined in any order.

Check out the hawkBit [update server](../hawkbit-runtime/hawkbit-update-server) as a reference.
