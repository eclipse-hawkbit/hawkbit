/**
 * <p>
 * After the HawkBit Target has executed an action, received by a GET(URL) request it reports the
 * completion of it to the HawkBit Server with an action status message, i.e. with a PUT message to the
 * feedback channel, i.e. PUT URL/feedback.
 * This message could be used not only at the end of execution but also as status updates during a longer lasting execution period.
 * The format of each action answer message is defined below at each action. But it is expected, that the contents of the message answers
 * have all a similar structure:
 * The content starts with a generic header and additional elements.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The answer header would look like: {
 *   "timestamp": "1733218554123",
 *   "status": {
 *      "execution": "closed",
 *      "result": {
 *         "final": "success",
 *         "progress": {}
 *      }
 *      "details": []
