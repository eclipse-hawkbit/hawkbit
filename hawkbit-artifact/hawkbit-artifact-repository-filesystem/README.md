# Eclipse.IoT hawkBit - Artifact Repository File System

This module contains the implementation of the `ArtifactRepository` based on the file-system.
It's a very convenient and easy implementation of storing the artifact binaries into the file-system based on the SHA-1
hash naming.

Due the limit of many file-systems of files within one directory, the files
are stored in different sub-directories based on the last four digits of the
SHA1-hash `/basepath/[two digit sha1]/[two digit sha1/sha1-hash-filename]`.
