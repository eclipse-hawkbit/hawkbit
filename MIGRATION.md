### Configuration Property changes

- `hawkbit.server.security.dos.maxTargetsPerManualAssignment` has changed to `hawkbit.server.security.dos.maxTargetDistributionSetAssignmentsPerManualAssignment`

## Milestone 0.3.0M7

### Configuration Property changes

- Due to Spring Boot version upgrade (see [spring boot 2.2 deprecations](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-2.2-Release-Notes#deprecations-in-spring-boot-22)) `server.use-forward-headers` has changed to `server.forward-headers-strategy`

## Upgrade from Master Branch (after 0.3.0M6) to 0.3.0M7

Due to changes in the DB migration scripts within PR [#1017](https://github.com/eclipse-hawkbit/hawkbit/pull/1017) the Hawkbit will not start up if one of the following cases is true:

- DB2 database is used
- MSSQL database is used and the `sp_action` table is not empty
- PostgreSql database is used and the `sp_action` table is not empty

The script was fixed with PR [#1061](https://github.com/eclipse-hawkbit/hawkbit/pull/1061).

In case you upgrade from 0.3.0M6 to 0.3.0M7 there is no issue. But if you have built the Hawkbit from the master branch between PR [#1017](https://github.com/eclipse-hawkbit/hawkbit/pull/1017) and PR [#1061](https://github.com/eclipse-hawkbit/hawkbit/pull/1061), use PostgreSQL or MSSQL and upgrade to 0.3.0M7, it will fail at startup with the message: `Validate failed: Migration checksum mismatch for migration version 1.12.16`

This can be fixed by adapting the schema_version table of the database. The checksum field of the entry with the version 1.12.16 has to be changed (mind the minus):

- -1684307461 for MSSQL
- -596342656 for PostgreSql

Example for MSSQL: `UPDATE schema_version SET checksum=-1684307461 WHERE version='1.12.16'`
